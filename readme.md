# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about schools and students in a district. The goal is to determine trends and insights from the data. The analysis is performed using the Pandas library in a Jupyter notebook.

## Data

The data is provided in two CSV files:

- `schools.csv`: Contains information about the schools.
- `students.csv`: Contains information about the students.

## Analysis Steps

1. **District Summary**: Calculate key metrics for the entire district.
2. **School Summary**: Calculate key metrics for each school.
3. **High and Low Performing Schools by Passing Rate**: Identify the top and bottom performing schools based on passing rates.
4. **Math Scores by Grade**: Analyze math scores for each grade.
5. **Reading Scores by Grade**: Analyze reading scores for each grade.
6. **Scores by School Spending**: Analyze scores based on school spending per student.
7. **Scores by School Size**: Analyze scores based on school size.
8. **Scores by School Type**: Analyze scores based on school type (Charter vs. District).

## Key Findings

1. Charter schools outperformed district schools in terms of passing rates in both math and reading.
2. Schools with smaller student populations outperformed schools with larger student populations in terms of passing rates in both math and reading.
3. Schools with higher per student spending did not necessarily outperform schools with lower per student spending in terms of passing rates in both math and reading.
4. Schools with higher passing rates in math also had higher passing rates in reading, and vice versa.
5. Schools with higher overall passing rates were more likely to be charter schools, have smaller student populations, and have lower per student spending.
